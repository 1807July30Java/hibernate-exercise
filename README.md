# hibernate-exercise

Hibernate exercise for Monday, Sept. 3

## Instuctions

Clone this repository and create a branch off of master. Naming 
convention: [Last name][First initial] just like your personal repos. 

The HibernateExercise project represents the backend for a study 
application. It manages two domain objects: Flashcards and Categories. 
A Flashcard has a Category, and many Flashcards can belong to the same 
Category. 
A Category may be Active or Inactive. (Note the use of enums).

Your task is to complete the Hibernate configuration and provide DAO 
implementations by 9am tomorrow, Sept. 4. (Remember to push!!)
